# it's Nurettin Berkay Demirkol

I am a software engineer with a strong interest in artificial intelligence. Currently, I founded my own startup and I’m actively developing it, while independently conducting research on self-learning models in the field of AI.

I'm developing a self-learning AI model called **SAVM** and **N-SAVM**, designed to adapt and improve autonomously.  
In addition, I'm building a lightweight and minimal vector search engine named **Schemantic**, inspired by FAISS and tailored for semantic web search.

I am currently working on building my own startup and simultaneously conduct research on self-learning AI models.
